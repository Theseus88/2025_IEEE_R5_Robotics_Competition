# 2025_IEEE_R5_Robotics_Competition

I thought this may help others get started with their code for the competition. Below is an image of the field that it creates so that the robot can have a 2D environment to work with. The code should be pretty easy to follow but if you have any questions feel free to ask! I wrote it over the week and with what tests I've ran everything seems to work as expected. In the main.cpp I have commented out sections that I left in if you want to run some of the tests I ran. The link to the graph created from the program is [here.](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f6scsjqbug)
